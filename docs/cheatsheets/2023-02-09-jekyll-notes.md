# Getting Started with Jekyll

* Step by step instructions can be found [here][jekyll-step-by-step]
* [Jekyll tutorial][jekyll-playlist] on Youtube

## Prerequisites

Jekyll is a Ruby gem and requires ruby and gem to be installed.

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
## Create and serve a new Jekyll site on your local machine

```
jekyll new new-site
cd new-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
bundle exec is required when configuration changes need to be aplied.

For changes to content the following is sufficient.
```
jekyll serve
```
## Managing Draft posts

To serve draft posts in _drafts folder, use:

```
jekyll serve --draft
```

drafts are served using current date

Use the default naming convention when a draft post is ready to be published.

## Permalinks

By default, Jekyll uses information in categories to create url for posts.

Custom permalinks can be crafted to override the Jekyll defaults. For example to avoid using the categories in the post url

```
permalink: /:year/:month/:day/:title
```
## Front matter defaults

are defined in the _config.yml file
## Jekyll themes

[Theme Search](https://rubygems.org/search?query=jekyl-theme)

install a theme by adding the theme to the gemfile e.g.

```
gem "jekyll-theme-hacker"
```

To install the theme, run
```
bundle install
```

Update the config file to use the theme.

To update the site to serve using the new theme, use

```
bundle exec
```

Be aware that if the new theme does not have layouts with the same names as the previous theme, pages will not render.
