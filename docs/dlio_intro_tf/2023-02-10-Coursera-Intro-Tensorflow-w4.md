# Notes from Week 4 of auditing the course

Fashion MNIST images has extremely clean and structured images.
In practice images will not be so structured. A handbag (as an example of a feature that we would like to detect) will likely not be centred in an image, but may appear anywhere in a larger picture e.g. on someone's arm

Image Generator in TF is used to generate training and test/validation images
## Image Generation

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image
import ImageDataGenerator

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
Images can be resized at runtime
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    # The name of the subdirectories in the training directory will be the labels for the images in that directory
    train_dir,
    # Images are processes as they are loaded from the directory
    target_size=(300,300),
    # Images are processes in batches. Batch size impact efficiency.
    batch_size=128,
    # Specifies that this is for binary classification
    class_mode='binary'

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    # The name of the subdirectories in the training directory will be the labels for the images in that directory
    validation_dir,
    # Images are processes as they are loaded from the directory
    target_size=(300,300),
    # Images are processes in batches. Batch size impact efficiency.
    batch_size=32,
    # Specifies that this is for binary classification
    class_mode='binary'
)
```
## Defining the model

```python
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

```

* Input shape is (300, 300, 3) - The 3 indicates the three byte depth for pixels in a colour image
* The final layer has 1 output as this is a binary classifcifier (There are 2 classes and 1 value is sufficent to encode this information)
* The learning rate can be tweaked. If large flucations in accuracy are observed between epochs when training, then the learning rate should be tweaked down.

## Fitting the model

```python
history = model.fit(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=15,
      verbose=1)
```

* The Steps per model is defined based on the batch size. 8 steps are needed in the example to load the training set in batches of size 128

## Validation using a test set

* The test of how good the model is, is determined by how it performs on images it has not previously seen. The accuracy of the model on training data is not enough.
* Accuracy on validation data can be expected to be lower than on the training data, as the model has not seen the validation data previosly.


## The effect of data compression on model accuracy

* Very high accuracy (~1 or >1) may be noted which indicates overfitting
* The lectures highlighted that using compression may result in faster training and higher accuracy, but performance on the model may be poorer. Specifically, images that are correctly trained using a larger dataset may be misclassfied.

## To Do

To do: Understand Loss vs accuracy. Are terms being used interchanegably and is this correct to do?
