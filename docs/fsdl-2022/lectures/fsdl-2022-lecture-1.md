# Course overview

## The commoditization of model training

* Deploy state of the art language and vision models with mnimum code
    * [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)
* Model as a service
    * [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/)
* Frameworks for models
    * [Keras](https://keras.io/)

## Progress of AI

* [5 Things you should know about AI - 2017 article](https://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/media/uploads/resources/AI%20Group/AIMobility-11.05.17-Cambridge_Consultants-Monty_Barlow.pdf)

## When to use ML 
* "...their value must outweigh not just the cost of developing them but also the additional complexity that these ML systems introduce to your software
    * ["The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt"](https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/)
  
## Finding high impact ML project

* Projects which will make predictions that are central to decision making cheaper.
    * ["Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI."](https://www.amazon.com/Prediction-Machines-Economics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1633695670)
* What a product needs
    * [Principles of Spotify's ML powered "Discover Weekly" feature](https://spotify.design/article/three-principles-for-designing-ml-powered-products)
* Parts of a system that is complex andd manually defined
    * [Andrej Karpathy's idea of Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)
    * Github Copilot
